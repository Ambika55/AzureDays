# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning using Microsoft Azure ‚ú®
  
### We will be showing how you can clean the data and create a simple ML model using Azure notebooks and you will aslo explore the power of Azure ML Studio! üòé   
The best part I love about Azure ML studio is, I can create a Machine Learning model using a simple flow. And not only this, It's so easy to use the trained ML model as a web service. üòç
  
One question for everyone would be: Have you ever wanted to predict the future? ü§î  
I would say, **YESSSS!!** (Obviously Yes!!!)  
Well, if correlating, predictions can be related to Machine Learning. As machine learns to predict based on the previous data.  
  
So, properly saying, Machine Learning is the branch where the machine learns from the data in order to preform some analysis. We can say like Handwritten Digit Recognition, Credit-card fraud detection,
